# How to use Daily Task?
You can easily setup this project by just download / clone / fork it and run index.html in your browser. I use localstorage (must like the cache for browser but is js component, so take extra caution in data that you stored can be lost if you run some cache cleaner like ccleaner or so). I use js, html, and some css. To make it more delightful I add some sweet alert to make it more beatifull.
